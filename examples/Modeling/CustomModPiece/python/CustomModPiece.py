    over $x\in[0,1]$ with boundary conditions $h(0)=0$ and
    $\partial h/\partial x =0$ at $x=1$.  This equation is a basic model of steady
    state fluid flow in a porous media, where $h(x)$ is the hydraulic head, $K(x)$
    is the hydraulic conductivity, and $f(x)$ is the recharge.

    This ModPiece uses linear finite elements on a uniform grid. There are two inputs,
    the conductivity $K(x)$, which is represented as piecewise constant within each
    of the $N$ cells, and the recharge $f(x)$, which is also piecewise constant in
    each cell.   There is a single output of this ModPice: the head $h(x)$ at the
    $N+1$ nodes in the discretization.
