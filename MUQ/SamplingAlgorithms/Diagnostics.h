      "Normalize"   | boolean | True  | If the parameters should be rank-transformed (i.e., normalized) before computing Rhat. |

      @param[in] collections A vector of SampleCollection variables returned by independent runs of an MCMC algorithm.  Assumes that all of the chains have the same length and were initialized with diffuse initial conditions.
      @returns A vector of \f$\hat{R}\f$ values for each component of the parameters.

      /** For a set of scalar values \f$\{x_1,\ldots, x_S\}\f$, the rank of \f$x_i\f$ is the index of \f$x_i\f$ after sorting this set into a list that satisfies \f$x_i\leq x_{i+1}\f$.  We use \f$r_i\f$  to denote the rank of \f$x_i\f$ and adopt the convention that for repeated values (i.e., \f$x_{i}=x_{i+1}\f$), \f$r_i\f$ is given by the average rank of consecutive repeated values.

      This function computes and returns the values of \f$r_i\f$ when the initial set is given by the combined states of multiple SampleCollections.   The states are vector-valued, but this function operates only on a single component of the state vector.

      @param[in] collections Several SampleCollection instances used to define the set of values we want to rank
      @param[in] dim The component of the vector-valued states that we want to rank.
      @return A std::vector of Eigen::VectorXd containing the ranks of all samples in all sample collections.  The std::vector has the same size as the std::vector of collections.  Following \cite Vehtari2021, "Average rank for ties are used to conserve the number of unique values of discrete quantities."
