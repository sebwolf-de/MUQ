# Overview
This is a fork from original muq2 (see description below) at commit 7fafda25. It was forked to enable some changes in the source code for my MA project to enable fused simulation runs in UQ_SeisSol.





## MUQ - Overview

Welcome to MUQ (pronounced “muck”), a modular software framework for defining and solving forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems.

## Purpose

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is important in many different applications.
MUQ aims to make advanced probabilistic UQ tools easy to use in either c++ or python,
and enable cutting-edge method development through its modular structure.

MUQ has a variety of capabilities, including:

*  Various Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
*  Graphical modeling with a mix of statistical and physical components.
*  Gaussian processes
*  Karhunen Loève expansions.
*  Transport maps
*  Nonlinear Optimization
*  Generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansions

## Installation:

MUQ is available on Linux and OSX as a conda package, docker image, or from source. For many users, getting started can be as easy as running

```
conda install -c conda-forge muq
```

For more installation options, check out the [installation guide](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/muqinstall.html).

## Getting Started

MUQ is composed of several different modules, which work together to define and solve UQ problems.  Documentation for each of these modules is included with our doxygen-generated [API documentation](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/index.html).   Most applications will require using the [modeling module](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/group__modeling.html) to define statistical models or interact with user-defined models.  Learning the basics of this module is therefore a good place to start.

#### Interested in forward UQ?

- First, get acquainted with the [modeling module](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/group__modeling.html).  You'll need to use one or more instances of the [ModPiece class](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/classmuq_1_1Modeling_1_1ModPiece.html) to define the model that will be evaluated by the UQ algorithm.
- Once you have a model, check out the [polynomial chaos module](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/group__polychaos.html).
- Other examples can be found by selecting the "PCE" examples on the MUQ [webpage](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/examples.html).

#### Want to tackle Bayesian inverse problems?

- Just like for forward UQ, you'll want to get familiar with the [modeling module](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/group__modeling.html) module to define a forward model.  The [WorkGraph class](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/classmuq_1_1Modeling_1_1WorkGraph.html) within the modeling module is also used to combine multiple components (e.g., the prior, forward model, and likelihood function) comprising the Bayesian posterior distribution.
- Look at methods in the [sampling algorithms](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/latest/group__sampling.html) module to generate samples of your Bayesian posterior.
- Other examples can be found by filtering the "MCMC" examples on the MUQ [webpage](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/examples.html).

You can also find many [examples](https://mituq.bitbucket.io/source/_site/examples.html) using both the c++ and Python interfaces to MUQ.  These examples can provide useful starting places for using MUQ on your own problems.
